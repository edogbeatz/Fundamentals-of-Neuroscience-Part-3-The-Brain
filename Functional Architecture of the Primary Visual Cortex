## Abstract

The primary visual cortex (V1), also known as the striate cortex, is the first cortical region to receive and process visual input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). This paper outlines the anatomical structure, laminar organization, and functional specialization of V1, with emphasis on retinotopic mapping, layer-specific inputs, and ocular dominance columns.

## 1. Introduction

Visual information processed by the retina is relayed via the optic nerve to the LGN, and subsequently transmitted to the cortex through optic radiations. The visual cortex, particularly V1, plays a crucial role in early-stage visual perception and feature extraction.

---

## 2. Cortical Structure

The cortex is a laminar, two-dimensional sheet approximately two millimeters thick. It consists of six histologically distinct layers. The V1 region is located in the occipital lobe and is situated along the calcarine sulcus. The striate cortex derives its name from the stria of Gennari, a prominent band in layer 4 visible in anatomical sections.

## 3. Retinotopic Mapping

Inputs from the LGN innervate the cortical sheet in an orderly, topographic fashion that preserves the spatial (x, y) arrangement of the retina. This organization is referred to as *retinotopy*, a key feature of V1.

## 4. Laminar Input Organization

- **Layer 4** receives dense input from magnocellular and parvocellular neurons via spiny stellate cells.
- **Layers 2 and 3** are primarily innervated by koniocellular axons.
- These inputs are highly segregated by eye of origin and contribute to binocular disparity processing.

## 5. Ocular Dominance Columns

Ocular dominance columns (ODCs) are alternating stripes of neurons in V1 that preferentially respond to input from one eye. These columns are visible in layer 4 and extend through other layers. ODCs are critical for binocular vision and have been central to studies of developmental plasticity.

### 5.1 Cortical Plasticity

Classic experiments in monocular deprivation revealed that blocking visual input from one eye during critical developmental periods results in the degradation of corresponding ODCs, demonstrating the plastic nature of the developing cortex.

## 6. Conclusion

The primary visual cortex is a finely structured and highly organized region, optimized for parallel and segregated visual processing. Its laminar architecture and retinotopic fidelity make it an essential model system for studying cortical function and plasticity.
