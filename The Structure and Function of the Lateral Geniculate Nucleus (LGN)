## üìç Location and General Overview

The **Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)** is located in the **dorsal lateral region of the thalamus**, between the **cerebral cortex** and the **midbrain**. While its full role is still being studied, the LGN plays a critical part in the early stages of visual processing.

## üß† Hemispheric Processing

- **Left LGN**: Processes input from the **right visual field**  
- **Right LGN**: Processes input from the **left visual field**

This contralateral mapping ensures each hemisphere processes data from the opposite side of the visual environment.

## üîç Layered Organization

The LGN is made up of **six distinct layers**:
- **Layers 1‚Äì2**: **Magnocellular (M-type)** ‚Äî large neurons; process **motion**
- **Layers 3‚Äì6**: **Parvocellular (P-type)** ‚Äî smaller neurons; process **shape and detail**
- **Koniocellular**: Tiny neurons **between layers**, likely involved in **color processing**

This architecture supports **parallel processing** of visual streams.

## üîÑ Functional Pathways

- **Magnocellular Pathway**  
  - Large center-surround receptive fields  
  - Transient bursts of activity for **motion detection**

- **Parvocellular Pathway**  
  - Small center-surround receptive fields  
  - Sustained responses for **form and fine detail**

- **Koniocellular Pathway**  
  - Processes **specific aspects of color information**

## üîÅ Cortical Feedback

Interestingly, **only ~20%** of excitatory input to the LGN comes from the retina.  
**~80%** comes from **feedback loops from the visual cortex**.

These loops are not fully understood but are believed to contribute to rhythmic brain activity observed in **EEG recordings**.
